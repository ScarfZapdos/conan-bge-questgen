Treemap graphs.

Could have action sequence by motivation.(maybe interesting but not necessary)

To test agent preference:
Give them all the same 10 goals and let them chose which one they want. (not interesting)


Have a graph for difference in actions versus action cost difference

If the prefences simulate intentionality, give the same goal to all agents and see how their plans differ. (Needs to have stats, put in future work)

Checking preferences in goal choosing.
